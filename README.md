# Notes on Book Designing Data-Intensive Applications

I am starting the above book and will be going through 1 chapter a week 
If anybody wants to discuss / draw diagrams / write some markdown notes, on a weekly basis for 60mins - get amogst.

## WEEKLY GOAL

- to recap and structurise the knowledge that was discovered in a chapter
- explain a chapter like 'I am 5 years old'
- draw diagrams
- take notes of important concepts
You have to actively contribute / participate

## Format

I was thinking about pairing format with the following setup

- 1 driver in a hot seat drawing / coding / writing notes - not asking questions
- 1 co-pilot who tells the driver what to do
- reest of the club commetee discussing with co-pilot what to note, record as an important takeaway / summary

## ALTERNATIVE:

- just to watch this BookCLub playlist(1-2hrs/chapter) -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqDAEH_2t6M&list=PLmp4AHm0u1g0Adn8HwWIe-G_xTn_jqOvf
- AND this summray of each chapter (15mins/chapter) -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdtlXdse7pw&list=PL4KdJM8LzAMecwInbBK5GJ3Anz-ts75RQ

## PS

This is a fantastic and very easy read I find.
