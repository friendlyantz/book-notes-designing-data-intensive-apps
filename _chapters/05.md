# Part II: Distributed Data

# Ch 5: Replication
## Leaders and Followers
### Synchronous vs. asynchronous replication
### Setting up new followers
### Handling node outages
1. Follower failure: catch-up recovery
2. Leader failure: failover
### Implementation of replication logs
1. Statement-based replication
2. Write-ahead log (WAL) shipping
3. Logical log replication
4. Trigger-based replication
## Problems With Replication Lag
### 1.Reading your own writes
### 2. Monotonic reads
### 3. Consistent prefix reads
### 4. Solutions for replication lag
## Multi-leader replication
### Use cases for multi-leader replication
### Handling write conflicts
### Multi-leader replication topologies
## Leaderless replication
### Writing to the database when a node is down
### Limitations of quorum consistency
### Sloppy quorums and hinted handoff
### Detecting concurrent writes
