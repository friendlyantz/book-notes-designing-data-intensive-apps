### Data-intensive vs Compute-Intensive
> CPU is rarely a limit these days. 
> usually it is:
> 	- amount of data
> 	- complexity of data
> 	- speed at which it is changing

### Thinking about Data Systems
- Boundaries between data systems(DBs, Caches, queues) are becoming blurred

- role of Software Engineer now also includes DataSystem designer (Arch?)
	- We have to address:
		- keeping data correct and complete during storm
		- providing consistent performance to clients, when sys is degraded
		- how to scale to handle increased load
		- what is a good API for this service?
	- factors:
		- team skill / exp
		- legacy sys
		- time-pressure
		- risk appetite
		- regulatory
		- etc etc
	- Note: what is legacy? assumptions/conventions w/o data

## Reliability
- fault-tolerant (aka resilient)
- fault vs failure
- Define scope of faults - we can't tackle them all (i.e diff region? alien invasion?)
- Essentially we build reliable sys from unreliable parts (i.e. my Mec*ano kit)
- we need to deliberatly trigger faults (i.e. kill processe w/o warning). Many bugs are due to poor error handling
- Netflix Chaos Monkey
- we prever tolerating faults over preventing faults

### Hardware Faults
-1st response: add redundancy - as it is well understood
	until recently hardware redundancy was sufficient, but it changes with the rise of flexibility and elasticity priorities, over single machine reliability
	Hence the move is towards systems that can tolerate the loss of machines, by using software fault-tolerance techniques (in preference OR in addition to hardware redundancy)
 
### Software Errors
### Human Error

## Maintainability

##### Simplicity - managing complexity
- Explosion of the state space
	accidental complexity vs essential complexity
##### Evolvability - making changes easy
