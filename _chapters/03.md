# Ch 3: Storage and Retrieval

While the group has heard of many concepts in this chapter and is reasonably comfortable with relational databases, we don't have great knowledge of non-relational terminology.

### Hash Indexes

Hash tables, or dictionaries, are common to many programming languages. Ruby has a Hash class, while JavaScript has both Objects and Maps.

Understanding Big-O notation is important to digesting this chapter.

The book says:
> As described so far, we only ever append to a file—so how do we avoid eventually running out of disk space? A good solution is to break the log into segments of a certain size by closing a segment file when it reaches a certain size, and making subsequent writes to a new segment file.

It wasn't well explained why having multiple files would stop you running out of disk space, by comparison to the compaction process. We believe, however, that you would want the compaction to occur on "closed" segments, so after a new segment is opened, the old segment can be compacted. It is also possible for the compaction process to fall behind if there is a spike in writes. In this case, lots of smaller segments might be faster to compact, at the expense of less effective compression.

Databases like PostgreSQL have a complex process for continuing to serve one version of a record while transactions create new versions. This is discussed in a later chapter so we won't dig into this now.

### LSM-Trees - Log Short Merge and SSTables (Sorted String)

AWS defaults to general SSD storage these days, but you can get a discount for purchasing magnetic storage.

An advantage of an SSTable over log segments with hash indexes is the data storage can be greater than the available memory. Now that memory is cheaper than when the book was written, it is more feasible to store a whole database in memory. This, however, is unlikely to be possible with a data-intensive application. While AWS offers instances with 24TiB of memory, this is more inconvenient data, rather than big data, and comes at a high cost (US$218.40ph)

LSM trees can be a lot faster for writes than a B-tree; however, they can be slower for reads since data can exist across multiple files and memory.

While we understand that a Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure that can tell you if a value would fit inside a set, we are not entirely clear on how they work.

### B-Trees Index

B-tree does not mean "binary tree", because B-trees can have more than 2 branches. We are choosing the believe that the "b" means "balanced", however:
> Bayer and McCreight never explained what, if anything, the B stands for: Boeing, balanced, between, broad, bushy, and Bayer have been suggested.

> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree

The book states that:
> A four-level tree of 4 KB pages with a branching factor of 500 can store up to 250 TB

The equation for this is:
```
Branching Factor ^ Levels * Page Size / (to_MB * to_GB * to_TB)
500              ^ 4      * 4         / (1000  * 1000  * 1000)
= 250 TB
```

### Other Indexing Structures

It's amazing how efficiently databases can find ranged data with multi-column filters, e.g. geospatial data. Most major databases (e.g. PostgreSQL and MySQL) are smart enough to use table statistics to use the best available index to minimise sequential scanning but need to fall back to a scan when handling any column filters not covered by an index. Thankfully, those same databases can combine multiple indexes to perform a single query. They can also use tricks like parallel sequential scanning to minimise load time.

It was surprising to learn that:
> the performance advantage of in-memory databases is not due to the fact that they don’t need to read from disk. Even a disk-based storage engine may never need to read from disk if you have enough memory, because the operating system caches recently used disk blocks in memory anyway. Rather, they can be faster because they can avoid the overheads of encoding in-memory data structures in a form that can be written to disk

When updating a value in a heap file:
> the record can be overwritten in place, provided that the new value is not larger than the old value. The situation is more complicated if the new value is larger, as it probably needs to be moved to a new location in the heap where there is enough space. In that case, either all indexes need to be updated to point at the new heap location of the record, or a forwarding pointer is left behind in the old heap location

This idea of moving data around and leaving pointers is reminiscent of a 2017 talk by Aaron Patterson on [compacting garbage collection in Ruby 2.7](https://youtu.be/8Q7M513vewk?t=1267).

## Column-Oriented Storage

There was a discussion about whether filters be more performant on row or column-based storage. The current theory is that column-based filtering could be faster because values are grouped. This does, however, assume that there is an order on the column.
